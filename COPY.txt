COPY Command Guide with Examples

COPY is a command-line tool used to copy one or more files from one location to another. It supports a variety of options for handling different types of files, merging multiple files, and customizing the behavior of the copy operation.


1. Syntax and Usage

Basic Syntax
 COPY [options] [/A|/B] source [/A|/B] [+ source2 [/A|/B]...] [destination [/A|/B]]
 or
 COPY source1 + source2.. destination [options]


Key Components:
 source - Pathname for the file(s) to be copied.
 /A - Specifies that the file is an ASCII text file. It will copy up to the end-of-file (EOF) marker.
 /B - Specifies that the file is a binary file. It will copy all extended characters. This is the default for copying  
 files unless merging multiple files.
 /D - Allows the destination file to be created decrypted (useful when copying encrypted files).
 destination - Pathname for the new file(s) or location where the file(s) will be copied to.
 /V - Verifies that the destination file, once written, can be read. No comparison with the source files occurs.
 /N - When possible, create only short filenames (8.3 format) in the destination. This can be helpful when copying  
 between differently formatted disks, such as NTFS and VFAT, or when archiving data to an ISO9660 CD-ROM.
 /L - If the source is a symbolic link, copy the link to the target instead of the actual file the source link points 
 to.
 /Y - Suppress the confirmation prompt when overwriting files.
 /-Y - Enable the confirmation prompt when overwriting files.
 /Z - If the copy is interrupted, the process can be resumed from where it left off. It also displays a progress  
 indicator with the percentage complete.
 /? - Displays help information for the COPY command.


2. Combining Files
You can combine multiple files into a single destination file by specifying a single destination but multiple source files. You can list the files with a + between each (e.g., file1+file2+file3), or use wildcards to select multiple files. Note that the first file must exist for the copy to succeed.

Example:
 COPY null + file1 + file2 destination


3. Binary Copies

The /B option allows copying in binary mode, which is the default behavior when files are copied without the /A option:
 COPY /B file1 file2

If you are merging multiple files, the /B option is required. It ensures that the copy operation handles all extended characters correctly.


4. Copying from the Console
You can use the COPY command interactively to create a new file by entering text from the console:

COPY CON filename.txt
After typing the desired content, press CTRL+Z to end the input and save the file.


5. Overwriting Destination Files

By default, COPY will prompt you before overwriting an existing file in the destination. To suppress this prompt and automatically overwrite files, you can set the COPYCMD environment variable:
 SET COPYCMD=/Y


6. Error Levels

The COPY command sets an ERRORLEVEL based on the success or failure of the operation:
 0 – The file(s) were successfully copied.
 1 – The file was not found or invalid parameters were given.

COPY prints error messages to STDOUT instead of STDERR. To log errors, you can filter the output by looking for the parenthesis character:
 COPY file1 file2 | FIND /v "(" > errlog.txt

This command will redirect error messages (and suppress normal output) to the errlog.txt file.


7. Examples
Example 1: Copy a File in the Current Folder

To copy a file file1.txt to file2.txt in the current folder:
 COPY file1.txt file2.txt


Example 2: Copy Multiple Files to a Folder

To copy multiple files (file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt) to the backup folder:
 COPY file1.txt + file2.txt + file3.txt backup\


Example 3: Copy Files with Verification

To copy file1.txt to file2.txt and verify the destination file after copying:
 COPY /V file1.txt file2.txt


Example 4: Copy a File in Binary Mode

To copy a file in binary mode, ensuring that extended characters are preserved:
 COPY /B file1.bin file2.bin


Example 5: Use Wildcards to Copy All .txt Files

To copy all .txt files in the current directory to the text_files folder:
 COPY *.txt text_files\


Example 6: Suppress Overwrite Prompt

To copy a file and automatically overwrite the destination without prompting:
 COPY /Y file1.txt file2.txt
