IPCONFIG /release [adapter]
IPCONFIG /release6 [adapter]
IPCONFIG /renew [adapter]
IPCONFIG /renew6 [adapter]
IPCONFIG /flushdns
IPCONFIG /registerdns
IPCONFIG /displaydns
IPCONFIG /showclassid adapter
IPCONFIG /showclassid6 adapter
IPCONFIG /setclassid adapter [classid]
IPCONFIG /setclassid6 adapter [classid]
IPCONFIG /?

[Key Options]
Displays full configuration information for all adapters.
Shows the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, DHCP status, and other network-related details for each adapter.
 /all

Releases the IPv4 address for the specified adapter.
If no adapter is specified, it releases the IP address for all adapters.
 /release [adapter]


Releases the IPv6 address for the specified adapter.
If no adapter is specified, it releases the IPv6 address for all adapters.
 /release6 [adapter]

Renews the IPv4 address for the specified adapter.
If no adapter is specified, it renews the IPv4 address for all adapters.
 /renew [adapter]

Renews the IPv6 address for the specified adapter.
If no adapter is specified, it renews the IPv6 address for all adapters.
 /renew6 [adapter]

Purges the DNS resolver cache, which can help resolve issues related to DNS resolution by clearing outdated or incorrect entries.
 /flushdns

Refreshes all DHCP leases and re-registers DNS names with the DNS server.
 /registerdns

Displays the contents of the DNS resolver cache, showing the cached DNS entries for quick reference.
 /displaydns

Displays all the DHCP class IDs allowed for the specified adapter.
Useful for checking which user classes the adapter supports for DHCP.
 /showclassid adapter

Displays all the IPv6 DHCP class IDs allowed for the specified adapter.
/showclassid6 adapter

Modifies the DHCP class ID for the specified adapter.
If no class ID is specified, the current class ID is removed.
/setclassid adapter [classid]

Modifies the IPv6 DHCP class ID for the specified adapter.
/setclassid6 adapter [classid]

Displays help information for the IPCONFIG command, listing all available options and their descriptions.
/?


Important Notes

Adapter names with spaces: If the adapter name contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes (example "Local Area Connection").

Wildcard support: Wildcards (* and ?) are supported for the adapter name. This allows you to specify multiple adapters with similar names (example *Ethernet* or *Con*).

Releasing IP during remote sessions: If you are remotely connected to a machine and run ipconfig /release, it will disconnect your remote session.

Class IDs and DHCP: The setclassid option allows the modification of DHCP class IDs, which are used to assign specific settings (examples DNS, gateway) to different groups of machines. These IDs need to be configured on the DHCP server.


Examples

Show Detailed Information
This command will display detailed configuration information for all network adapters on the system.
 C:\> ipconfig /all


Release and Renew All Adapters

This releases and renews the IP address for all adapters.
 C:\> ipconfig /release
 C:\> ipconfig /renew


Release and Renew All Adapters in One Line
This one-liner releases and then renews the IP addresses for all adapters.
 C:\> ipconfig /release && ipconfig /renew


Renew Connection Starting with "EL"
This command renews the connection for any adapter whose name starts with "EL".
 C:\> ipconfig /renew EL*


Release Connections Matching "Con"
This command releases the IP addresses for all connections with names matching "Con" (example "Local Area Connection 1").
 C:\> ipconfig /release *Con*


Set the DHCP Class ID
This command sets the DHCP class ID to "TEST" for the "Local Area Connection" adapter.
 C:\> ipconfig /setclassid "Local Area Connection" TEST


Errorlevels
 0: The command was successful.
 1: An error occurred during the operation.


Use Cases

Network Troubleshooting: ipconfig is commonly used to view and manage network configurations, troubleshoot connectivity issues, or reset network settings.
DHCP Configuration: setclassid can be used to adjust DHCP class IDs for devices, allowing customization of network settings based on different groups.
