TASKLIST Command Guide with Examples

TASKLIST is a command-line tool that provides a list of currently running processes on a local or remote machine. It displays information such as the process name, process ID (PID), memory usage, and more. Below is a brief guide with syntax and examples.


1. Syntax and Usage

[SYNTAX]
Display a List of Running Processes
 TASKLIST [/S system [/U username [/P [password]]]] [/M module] [/V] [/FI filter] [/FO format] [/NH] [/?]

[Key]
 /S system - The name or IP address of a remote machine to query.
 /U username - The user account to connect with (for remote systems).
 /P password - The password associated with the user account (if required).
 /M module - Displays all tasks that have a specific module (DLL) loaded.
 /V - Displays detailed information about the processes, including memory usage, session, and user.
 /FI filter - Filters the task list based on specified criteria (e.g., task name, PID, session name).
 /FO format - Specifies the output format: TABLE, LIST, or CSV.
 /NH - Suppresses the column header in the output.
 /? - Displays help information about the command.


2. Examples

Example 1: Display All Running Processes
To display a simple list of all running processes on the local machine:
 TASKLIST

[Output]
 Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
 ========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
 svchost.exe                   1234 Services                   0      10,000 K
 explorer.exe                  5678 Console                    1     150,000 K
 cmd.exe                       4321 Console                    1       5,000 K


Example 2: Display Processes on a Remote Machine
To display the list of processes running on a remote machine named RemotePC:
 TASKLIST /S RemotePC

Example 3: Display Processes with a Specific Module Loaded
To list all processes that have a specific DLL (kernel32.dll) loaded:
 TASKLIST /M kernel32.dll

Example 4: Filter Processes by Name
To display only the processes named explorer.exe:
 TASKLIST /FI "IMAGENAME eq explorer.exe"

Example 5: Display Detailed Information
To display detailed information, including memory usage and user information, for all processes:
 TASKLIST /V

[Output]
 Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage    Status          User Name
 ========================= ======== ================ =========== ============ ============    ============
 svchost.exe                   1234 Services                   0      10,000 K    Running        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
 explorer.exe                  5678 Console                    1     150,000 K    Running        User1
 cmd.exe                       4321 Console                    1       5,000 K    Running        User2

Example 6: Display Task List in CSV Format
To display the task list in CSV format:
 TASKLIST /FO CSV

[Output]
 "Image Name","PID","Session Name","Session#","Mem Usage"
 "svchost.exe","1234","Services","0","10,000 K"
 "explorer.exe","5678","Console","1","150,000 K"
 "cmd.exe","4321","Console","1","5,000 K"

Example 7: Display Processes with No Column Header
To display processes without the column header:
 TASKLIST /NH


3. Filters for /FI Option

The /FI option allows filtering of processes based on various criteria. Some common filters include:
 IMAGENAME eq processname - Filters by process name.
 PID eq processid - Filters by process ID.
 STATUS eq running - Filters by the running status of the process.
 SESSIONNAME eq console - Filters by session name.
 MEMUSAGE gt size - Filters by memory usage (greater than the specified size).

Example:
 TASKLIST /FI "MEMUSAGE gt 100000"

This command will filter and display processes using more than 100,000 KB of memory.


4. Output Formats (/FO)

The /FO option allows you to specify the format of the output. The following formats are supported:
 TABLE: A standard table format (default).
 LIST: A list format, displaying each process in a list with detailed properties.
 CSV: A comma-separated values format (useful for importing into Excel or other tools).

Example:
 TASKLIST /FO LIST

[Output]
 Image Name:   svchost.exe
 PID:          1234
 Session Name: Services
 Session#:     0
 Mem Usage:    10,000 K
 Status:       Running
 User Name:    NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM


5. Errorlevel
 0 - Successfully listed the processes.
 1 - Invalid filter or an invalid command was issued.
 2 - A specified file or process could not be found (if the specified machine is unreachable).
