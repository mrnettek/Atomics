PUSHD Command Guide with Examples

PUSHD is a command used to change the current directory or folder while storing the previous path so that it can be easily returned to using the POPD command. This is useful for navigating between directories in batch scripts or in interactive command-line use.


1. Syntax and Usage

[SYNTAX]
PUSHD [drive]path
 PUSHD
 drive: The drive letter to switch to.
 path: The folder or directory to make 'current' (UNC paths are accepted).

 If the drive is not specified, the current drive will be assumed.
 If neither a drive nor a path is specified, PUSHD will display a list of previously used directories. You can return  
 to these directories by using POPD one or more times.
 
 The number of directories pushed can be displayed using the $+ variable in the prompt.


2. Key Notes
UNC Paths: When a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path is specified, PUSHD will create a temporary drive map and use that new drive. Temporary drive letters are assigned in reverse alphabetical order, starting with Z:.

File vs Folder: If the specified path is a file (not a folder), or if the path does not exist, PUSHD will return an ERRORLEVEL of 1.


3. Batch File Usage

When using PUSHD in a batch script, it is highly recommended to check the %ERRORLEVEL% to ensure the directory change was successful before proceeding with further commands.

Example 1: Check if Directory Exists
 PUSHD \\install_server\wsus_share
 :: If this fails, exit the script
 IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 GOTO :EOF
 :: other commands...

Example 2: One-line Error Handling
 PUSHD "%~1" 2>nul || GOTO sub-error-failed

This approach ensures that if the directory change fails, the script will exit or handle the failure appropriately.


4. Run as Administrator

When a batch script is run as Administrator, the default directory is often set to C:\windows\system32\. To restore the original working directory (where the batch file is located), use the following command:
 PUSHD "%~dp0"

This will set the current directory to the directory where the batch script is located.



[EXAMPLES]
 
Example 1: Change to a Specific Directory
To change to a specific directory (C:\Program Files):
 PUSHD C:\Program Files

Example 2: Use PUSHD with UNC Path
To map a network drive temporarily for the UNC path \\server\share:
 PUSHD \\server\share

Example 3: List Previously Used Paths
If no path is specified, PUSHD will display a list of previously used paths:
 PUSHD

Example 4: Check Directory Availability and Handle Errors
In a batch script, check if a network path is available before proceeding:
 PUSHD \\server\share
 IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 GOTO :Error
 :: Proceed with further commands...


[RETURN CODES]

Errorlevels
 0: If the directory was successfully changed.
 1: If the directory does not exist or is not accessible, or if an invalid switch was used.


[NOTES]

Command Extensions: If command extensions are disabled, the PUSHD command will not be able to map temporary drives to UNC paths, and POPD will not delete those drives.

Drive Mapping Behavior: PUSHD maps UNC paths to available drive letters starting from Z:, and these mappings are temporary. Once POPD is used, the drive mappings are removed.
