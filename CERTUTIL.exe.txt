CERTUTIL Command Guide with Examples

CERTUTIL is a command-line utility installed as part of Certificate Services in Windows. It allows you to manage certificates, certificate authorities (CA), and related configurations, as well as back up and restore CA components. 

CERTUTIL also helps with verifying certificates, key pairs, and certificate chains.

 SHA512


3. Certutil Options Overview

CERTUTIL is used for a variety of tasks, including:
 Displaying Certificate Authority configuration information.
 Configuring and managing Certificate Services.
 Verifying certificates, certificate chains, and key pairs.
 Backing up and restoring CA components.

The command options allow you to customize its behavior in various use cases, from simple tasks like viewing certificates to more complex operations such as managing CA properties, generating certificate files, and working with policies.


4. Example Usage

Example 1: View Current CA Configuration

To view the configuration of the current Certification Authority:
 CERTUTIL -config


Example 2: Generate an SST File Using Automatic Update Mechanism

To generate an SST file from the automatic update mechanism:
 CERTUTIL -generateSSTFromWU "C:\path\to\SSTfile.sst"


Example 3: Export a Certificate to a File

Export a certificate to a file using the PFX encryption:
 CERTUTIL -exportPFX -p "password" -out "C:\path\to\certificate.pfx" "CertID"


Example 4: Display Information About a Specific Certificate

To display detailed information about a specific certificate:
 CERTUTIL -dump "C:\path\to\certificate.cer"


Example 5: Verify a Certificate

To verify a certificate, use the following command:
 CERTUTIL -verify "C:\path\to\certificate.cer"


Example 6: Display Detailed Information (Verbose)

For verbose output when displaying certificate information:
 CERTUTIL -v -dump "C:\path\to\certificate.cer"


Example 7: Sync Certificates with Windows Update

Sync certificates with Windows Update to a specified directory:
 CERTUTIL -syncWithWU "C:\path\to\destination"


5. Error Levels

CERTUTIL sets the following exit codes based on the outcome of the command:
 0: The command completed successfully.
 1: An invalid option was specified or the command failed.
 2: The specified certificate or component was not found.
 5: Access was denied (likely a permissions issue).
 32: The operation could not be completed because the directory is in use.
 145: The directory was not empty.


6. Additional Notes

CERTUTIL replaces the File Checksum Integrity Verifier (FCIV) found in earlier versions of Windows.

It is a tool primarily used by developers and IT administrators to view and manage certificates.

CERTUTIL is not recommended for production code and does not guarantee live site support or application compatibility.
