PING Command Help Guide
The PING command is used to test the network connection between your computer and another host. It sends an ICMP Echo Request message to the destination host and waits for a reply, showing the round-trip time taken for the message to reach the destination and return. This can help in troubleshooting network connectivity issues.


1. Syntax

[Syntax]
 PING [options] destination_host

 Where:
 destination_host: The hostname or IP address of the remote system you want to test connectivity with.


2. Options

Timeout and Other Time Settings

 -w timeout Sets the timeout in milliseconds for each reply (default is 4000ms).
  -w 5000 (Wait 5 seconds before timing out).

 -i TTL Set the Time To Live (TTL) for the packet. TTL specifies the maximum number of hops (routers) the packet can travel through before being discarded.

 -v TOS Set the Type Of Service (TOS) for the packet, used to prioritize traffic.


Network and Host Resolution

 -a Resolve addresses to hostnames.
  PING -a 192.168.1.1.

-n count Specifies the number of echo requests to send.
 -n 5 (Send 5 ping requests).

-t Pings the destination host continuously until interrupted.

To stop, press Ctrl-C.

To view statistics, press Control-Break.


Packet Size and Behavior

 -l size Specifies the buffer size (default is 32 bytes).
 -l 64 (Send 64-byte packets).

 -f Set the "Don't Fragment" flag in the packet. This is IPv4-only.
 -r count Records the route for a specified number of hops (IPv4-only).
 -s count Timestamps for the specified number of hops (IPv4-only).
 -j host_list Specifies a loose source route for the packet (IPv4-only).
 -k host_list Specifies a strict source route for the packet (IPv4-only).


IPv6 and Source Address

-R Use routing header to test reverse route (IPv6-only).
-S srcaddr Specifies the source address to use when sending packets.
-4 Forces the use of IPv4 for the connection.
-6 Forces the use of IPv6 for the connection.


3. Special Cases and Features

Request Timed Out

A "Request Timed Out" message indicates no response was received within the timeout period.

If you're testing a non-responsive host or a host that's offline, you may experience delays due to DNS resolution timeouts.

Success and Error Detection

To reliably detect a successful ping, you can pipe the output into the FIND command and look for the "TTL" value in the response.
 PING 192.168.1.1 | FIND "TTL"

Note: A "Reply" message in the output doesn't necessarily mean a successful ping. For example, "Reply from 192.168.1.254: Destination Net Unreachable" indicates that the host exists but cannot be reached due to network issues.


4. Common Use Cases

1. Verify Local TCP/IP Configuration

Ping the loopback address to ensure TCP/IP is correctly installed:
 PING 127.0.0.1


2. Verify Local Network Configuration
Ping the IP address of your local machine to verify it is correctly configured:
 PING 192.168.1.100


3. Verify Connectivity to Default Gateway
Ping the default gateway to ensure the local network can access external networks:
 PING 192.168.1.1


4. Test Connectivity to a Remote Host
Ping a remote server or host to verify connectivity through a router:
 PING 8.8.8.8


5. Use PING to Create a Delay
Ping the loopback address multiple times to create a delay. For example, a delay of 5 seconds can be created by pinging 6 times:
 PING -n 6 127.0.0.1 > nul


5. Performance and Timeout Considerations

Timeouts and Delays: When pinging an offline host, the timeout for the request is typically around 9-10 seconds. Once the host has been pinged once, DNS caching will speed up subsequent pings.
Performance: PING, Get-CIMInstance, PSPING, and Test-Connection (PowerShell) all provide comparable performance for network testing. The only difference is that PING and Get-CIMInstance allow modifications to the ICMP timeout.


6. Examples

1. Ping with Custom Timeout

Set the timeout for each reply to 5 seconds:
 PING -w 5000 192.168.1.1


2. Continuous Ping

Ping a host until manually stopped, displaying the statistics:
 PING -t 192.168.1.1


3. Ping with Custom Packet Size

Ping a host with a buffer size of 64 bytes:
 PING -l 64 192.168.1.1


4. Ping with Multiple Requests

Send 5 ping requests to a host:
 PING -n 5 192.168.1.1
