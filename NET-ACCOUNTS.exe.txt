NET ACCOUNTS, NET USER, NET GROUP Help Guide

These commands allow administrators to manage user accounts and groups on both local and remote systems, set password policies, and configure logon restrictions.



1. NET ACCOUNTS

The NET ACCOUNTS command allows you to manage password policies and user account restrictions.

[Syntax]
NET ACCOUNTS [/FORCELOGOFF:{minutes | NO}] [/MINPWLENGTH:length]
       [/MAXPWAGE:{days | UNLIMITED}] [/MINPWAGE:days] [/UNIQUEPW:number] [/DOMAIN]

[Options]
 /FORCELOGOFF:minutes: Specifies the number of minutes a user has before being forced to log off when the account expires or valid logon hours expire. If set to NO, no logoff is forced.
 /MINPWLENGTH:length: Specifies the minimum password length. The default is 6 characters, with a range of 0-14.
 /MAXPWAGE:days: Specifies the maximum password age in days. A value of UNLIMITED prevents passwords from expiring. The default is 90 days.
 /MINPWAGE:days: Specifies the minimum number of days that must pass before a user can change their password.
 /UNIQUEPW:number: Requires that new passwords be different from the specified number of previous passwords (1-24).
 /DOMAIN: Applies the changes to the domain rather than the local computer.


[EXAMPLES]

Example 1: View the current password and logon restrictions for the local machine.

2. NET USER

The NET USER command is used to manage user accounts. You can add, delete, modify, and view user account properties.

[Syntax]
 NET USER username {password | *} /ADD [options] [/DOMAIN]

 NET USER username [/DELETE] [/DOMAIN]
 NET USER username [/TIMES:{times | ALL}]

 /TIMES:{times | ALL}: Specifies the valid logon times for the user. Use ALL to allow the user to log in at any time.
 /ACTIVE:{YES | NO}: Sets the account as active or inactive.
 /DOMAIN: Applies the changes to the domain.

Example 1: Create a new user account 'LocalUser64' with the password 'Secr3t'.
 NET USER LocalUser64 Secr3t /ADD

Example 2: View details of user account 'Ella'.
 NET USER Ella

The NET GROUP command is used to manage domain groups, and NET LOCALGROUP is used to manage local groups. You can add or remove users from groups, create or delete groups, and modify group properties.

 NET GROUP groupname {/ADD [/COMMENT:"text"] | /DELETE} [/DOMAIN]
 NET LOCALGROUP groupname {/ADD [/COMMENT:"text"] | /DELETE} [/DOMAIN]

 NET LOCALGROUP guests LocalScanningGroup /ADD

Example 3: Remove the group from 'guests'.
 NET LOCALGROUP guests LocalScanningGroup /DELETE

Example 3: Delete the local group 'LocalScanningGroup'.
 NET LOCALGROUP LocalScanningGroup /DELETE
