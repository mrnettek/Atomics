POPD Command Guide with Examples

POPD is a command used to change the current directory back to the path most recently stored by the PUSHD command. It also removes any temporary drive mappings created by PUSHD. This command allows you to navigate back through directories in a "stack" (LIFOâ€”last in, first out) order, making it easier to return to previous directories.


1. Syntax and Usage

[Syntax]
 POPD


2. Key Notes
Stack Principle: PUSHD and POPD operate on a stack (LIFO principle). This means that each time PUSHD is used, the current directory is stored in the stack, and POPD returns you to the most recent directory pushed.
Temporary Drive Mapping: If a UNC path (\\server\share) is used with PUSHD, a temporary drive map is created. POPD will remove that temporary drive mapping once you return to the previous directory.


[EXAMPLES]

Example 1: Basic Directory Navigation
Use PUSHD to change to C:\utils:
 PUSHD c:\utils

Use PUSHD again to change to C:\Windows:
 PUSHD c:\Windows

Use POPD to return to C:\utils:
 POPD

Use POPD again to return to C:\Program Files:
 POPD

Example 2: Using POPD with UNC Path
Use PUSHD to map a UNC path temporarily (\\server\share):
 PUSHD \\server\share

Use POPD to return to the previous directory, removing the temporary drive mapping:
 POPD


[RETURN CODES]

Errorlevels
 0: The directory change was successful and the temporary drive mapping (if applicable) was removed.
 1: The stack is empty, or the previous directory cannot be accessed.


[NOTES]

Multiple POPD Usage: You can use POPD multiple times to navigate back through directories if you have used PUSHD multiple times.

Command Extensions: If command extensions are disabled, POPD will not remove temporary drive mappings for UNC paths created by PUSHD.
