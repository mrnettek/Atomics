ROBOCOPY Command Guide with Examples

ROBOCOPY (Robust File and Folder Copy) is a powerful command-line tool used to copy files and entire directory trees from one location to another. It offers advanced features like multi-threaded copying, filtering options, and support for resuming interrupted transfers.


1. Syntax and Usage

[Syntax]
 ROBOCOPY Source_folder Destination_folder [files_to_copy] [options]
 source_folder: Path to the source folder or file(s) to be copied. Wildcards are accepted (C:\demo\*.txt).
 destination_folder: Path to the destination folder. The destination must be different from the source.
 files_to_copy: A list of files or a wildcard pattern. Defaults to copying *.*.
 
 [options]: Any combination of the options listed below.


2. Source Options
 /S: Copy subfolders, excluding empty ones.
 /E: Copy subfolders, including empty ones. Equivalent to /S + /E.
 /A: Copy only files with the archive attribute set.
 /M: Like /A, but removes the archive attribute from source files.
 /LEV:n: Only copy the top n levels of the source tree.
 /MAXAGE:n: Exclude files older than n days or a specific date (YYYYMMDD).
 /MINAGE:n: Exclude files newer than n days or a specific date (YYYYMMDD).
 /FFT: Assume FAT file times with 2-second date/time granularity. Useful for copying to non-Windows file systems like Linux NAS.
 /256: Turn off long path support (files with paths longer than 256 characters).


3. Copy Options

/COPY:copyflags: Specifies what to copy for files. Default is /COPY:DAT. Flags include:
 D = Data
 A = Attributes
 T = Timestamps
 S = Security (NTFS ACLs)
 O = Owner info
 U = Auditing info

/DCOPY:DCflags: Specifies what to copy for directories. Default is /DCOPY:DA. Flags include:
 D = Data
 A = Attributes
 T = Timestamps
 E = Extended attributes (EAs)
 X = Skip alternate data streams
 /COPYALL: Copy all file information (/COPY:DATSOU).
 /NOCOPY: Copy no file information (useful with /PURGE).
 /NODCOPY: Do not copy directory info (default is /DCOPY:DA).
 /SEC: Copy file security information (/COPY:DATS).
 /B: Copy files in backup mode (preserves NTFS permissions).
 /EFSRAW: Copy encrypted files using raw EFS mode.
 /L: List only, without copying, timestamping, or deleting files.
 /MOV: Move files (delete from source after copying).
 /MOVE: Move files and directories (delete from source after copying).
 /SJ: Copy junctions as junctions instead of the target.
 /SL: Copy symbolic links instead of their target.


4. Performance Tweaks
 /COMPRESS: Request SMB network compression during file transfer, if applicable.
 /J: Use unbuffered I/O (recommended for large files).
 /NOOFFLOAD: Copy files without using Windows Copy Offload mechanism.
 /IPG:n: Set the inter-packet gap (in milliseconds) to free bandwidth on slow lines.
 /MT[:n]: Multithreaded copying. Use n threads (default is 8, range 1-128). Not compatible with /IPG or /EFSRAW.
 /REG: Save /R:n and /W:n (retry and wait time) settings in the registry as default.
 /TBD: Wait for share names to be defined (retry error 67).


5. Destination Options
 /A+:[RASHCNET]: Add file attributes to destination files (read-only, system).
 /A-:[RASHCNET]: Remove file attributes from destination files.
 /FAT: Use 8.3 FAT file names only for the destination.
 /CREATE: Create a directory tree with zero-length files only.
 /DST: Compensate for one-hour daylight saving time (DST) differences.
 /PURGE: Delete destination files/folders that no longer exist in the source.
 /MIR: Mirror a directory tree (equivalent to /PURGE + /E).
 /SECFIX: Update ACL file security on all files, even skipped files.
 /XJ: Exclude junction points from source.
 /XJD: Exclude junction points from source directories.
 /XJF: Exclude junction points from source files.


6. Logging Options
 /L: List only, don’t copy, timestamp, or delete any files.
 /NP: No progress display; don’t show percentage of copied files.
 /LOG:file: Output status to a log file (overwrite existing log).
 /UNILOG:file: Output status to a Unicode log file (overwrite existing log).
 /LOG+:file: Append status to the existing log file.
 /UNILOG+:file: Append status to the existing Unicode log file.
 /TEE: Output to both console and log file.
 /TS: Include source file timestamps in the output.
 /FP: Include full pathnames of files in the output.
 /NS: No size logging; don’t log file sizes.
 /NC: No class logging; don’t log file classes.
 /NFL: No file list logging; don’t log file names.
 /NDL: No directory list logging; don’t log directory names.
 /NJH: No job header in the log (remove the ROBOCOPY header).
 /NJS: No job summary in the log.
 /X: Report all extra files (files not selected or copied).
 /V: Verbose logging, showing skipped files.


7. Job Options
 /JOB:jobname: Read parameters from the specified job file (/XF files, /XD directories).
 /SAVE:jobname: Save parameters to a job file, but don’t run the command. The .RCJ file is an editable text file.
 /NOSD: No source directory specified.
 /NODD: No destination directory specified.
 /QUIT: Quit after processing the command line to view parameters.
 /IF: Include the following files.


8. Repeated Copy Options
/MON:n: Monitor source directory and run again when more than n changes are detected.
/MOT:m: Monitor source directory and run again in m minutes if any changes are detected.
/RH:hhmm-hhmm: Specify run hours (e.g., /RH:1800-0200).
/PF: Check run hours on a per-file basis.


9. Exclude/Include Options
 /XO: Exclude older files; don’t overwrite files that are the same date or newer than the source.
 /XC: Exclude changed files.

 /XL: Exclude files and directories present in the source but not in the destination.
 /XX: Exclude extra files and directories present in the destination but not in the source.

File and Directory Exclusion:
 /XF file1 file2...: Exclude files matching given names/paths.
 /XD dirs...: Exclude directories matching given names/paths.


10. Advanced Options
 /BYTES: Print file sizes in bytes.
 /DEBUG: Show debug volume information (undocumented).
 /ETA: Show the estimated time of arrival for copied files.
 /LFSM: Operate in "low free space" mode, allowing pause and resume.
