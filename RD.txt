RD Command Guide with Examples

RD (Remove Directory) is a command-line tool used to delete an empty directory or a directory along with its contents. This command can also be used to remove entire directory trees and folders.


1. Syntax and Usage

[SYNTAX]
RD pathname
 RD /S pathname
 RD /S /Q pathname
 pathname: The directory path to be deleted.
 /S: Delete all files and subfolders in addition to the folder itself. Use this to remove an entire folder tree.
 /Q: Quiet mode. Do not display a confirmation prompt (Y/N).


2. Key Notes
Without /S: RD will only delete an empty directory. If the directory is not empty, RD will silently fail without returning any errors unless /Q is specified.

With /S: RD will delete all files and subfolders in the specified directory. This allows you to remove entire folder structures, including all nested directories and files.

Quiet Mode (/Q): When using /Q, the command will not prompt for confirmation before deleting the directory or its contents. This is useful for automated scripts where user input is not desired.

Junction Points: If the directory is a Junction Point (a type of symbolic link), RD without /S will remove the junction point itself, but it will not remove the target directory of the junction.

Long Pathnames: If the directory path contains spaces, use double quotes to enclose the full pathname. For example:
 RD "C:\My Folder"


3. Deleting a Directory with a Trailing Space

Windows Explorer may not allow the deletion of a directory that has a trailing space, displaying the error: "Could Not Find This Item". To bypass this and delete the directory, escape the closing quote, as shown below:
 RD "this has a trailing space \"


4. Example Usage

Example 1: Delete an Empty Directory
To delete an empty directory C:\docs\Jan:
 RD C:\docs\Jan

Example 2: Delete a Directory and Its Contents
To delete a directory C:\docs\Jan along with all of its files and subdirectories:
 RD /S C:\docs\Jan

Example 3: Quiet Deletion (No Confirmation Prompt)
To delete a directory and its contents without any confirmation prompt (DANGERZONE):
 RD /S /Q C:\docs\Jan

Example 4: Delete Multiple Directories
To delete multiple directories in one command:
 RD C:\docs\Jan "C:\My Documents\Mar"


[RETURN CODES]

5. Errorlevels
RD does not return a standard error level to the shell, but it sets an exit code based on the result of the command:
 0: Directory deleted successfully.
 1: Invalid option.
 2: Directory not found.
 5: Access denied (permission issues).
 32: Directory in use (e.g., if the directory is open or being used by a process).
 145: Directory not empty.

To detect non-zero exit codes and handle failures, you can use conditional execution, for example:
 RD NonExistentFolder || Echo This failed!


[NOTES]

No Wildcards: The RD command does not support wildcards for directory names. You need to specify the exact directory name or path.

Deleting System Folders: Be cautious when using RD with system or protected folders. Access may be denied if the required permissions are not granted.
