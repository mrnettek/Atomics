TAKEOWN.exe Help File

TAKEOWN.exe is a command-line utility used to take ownership of a file or folder. This command is typically used when a user needs to assume control over a file or folder that they don't currently have ownership of, allowing them to change permissions or delete the object.

[SYNTAX]
TAKEOWN [/s Computer [/u [Domain\]UserName [/p [Password]]]]
         /f FileName [/a] [/r [/d {Y|N}]]

[OPTIONS]
The name or IP address of the remote computer where the file or folder resides. Do not use backslashes. The default is the local computer.
 /s Computer

Run the command with the permissions of the specified user account. If not specified, the command runs with the system permissions.
 /u [Domain]UserName

The password associated with the user account specified in the /u parameter.
 /p [Password]

The name of the file or folder whose ownership you wish to take. It can be a file path, a UNC path, or a directory. Wildcard characters * can be used for pattern matching.
 /f FileName

Grant ownership to the Administrators group instead of the current user.
 /a

Perform a recursive operation on all files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
 /r

Suppress the confirmation prompt when the user does not have the "List Folder" permission on a specified directory. The options are:
 /d {Y|N}

 Y: Take ownership of the directory.
 N: Skip the directory. This option is only applicable when using the /r option.


[IMPORTANT]

File/Folders in Use:

If the file or folder is open or locked, it may not be possible to change ownership or permissions without closing the file locks. This can be done via Computer Management ➞ Shared Folders ➞ Open files.

Ownership Transfer:
After taking ownership of a file or folder, you can modify the file permissions or delete it as needed.

No Mixed Patterns:
TAKEOWN does not support mixed patterns such as ? and * together.


[Examples]

Example 1: Transfer ownership of a specific file to the Administrators group.
 takeown.exe /f D:\demo\sample.xlsx /a

Example 2: Take ownership of all files in a folder (recursively) and assign ownership to the Administrators group.
 takeown.exe /f "D:\demo\*" /a /r

Example 3: Take ownership of a file on a remote computer.
 takeown.exe /s 192.168.1.1 /u Administrator /p password /f "C:\files\file.txt"

Example 4: Take ownership of files in a folder but skip directories where permission issues exist.
 takeown.exe /f "D:\demo\*" /r /d N


[RETURN CODES]

Errorlevels
 0: Ownership successfully taken.
 1: Invalid parameters or failed operation (e.g., permission issues).
 2: The specified file or folder does not exist.
