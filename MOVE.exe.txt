MOVE Command Guide with Examples

The MOVE command is used to move a file or folder from one location to another or to rename it. It can also be used to move multiple files using wildcards.


1. Syntax and Usage

[SYNTAX]
MOVE [options] [Source] [Target]
 Source: The path and filename of the file(s) to move.
 Target: The path and filename to move file(s) to.

Options: Additional flags to modify the command's behavior.

[OPTIONS]
 /Y: Suppress confirmation prompt when overwriting files.
 /-Y: Enable confirmation prompt when overwriting files. By default, confirmation is enabled unless the command is executed in a batch script.


[EXAMPLES]

Example 1. Rename a file in the current folder.
Unlike the REN command, this will overwrite the destination file if it already exists.
 MOVE oldfile.wp newfile.doc

Example 2. Move a file with full paths specified.
Moves a file from g:\department to c:\Files to Convert, and renames it.
 MOVE g:\department\oldfile.wp "c:\Files to Convert\newfile.doc"

Example 3. Move a file between different drives.
This command assumes both drives are in the current folder.
 MOVE a:oldfile.wp c:newfile.doc

Example 4. Specify source only, and the file is moved to the current folder.
This moves oldfile.wp from g:\department to the current directory, keeping the same filename.
 MOVE g:\department\oldfile.wp

Example 5. Quiet move (no feedback on the screen).
This moves the file oldfile.docx to newfile.docx without any output.
 MOVE oldfile.docx newfile.docx >nul

Example 6. Move a file but avoid overwriting if the destination file already exists.
This ensures that the command will not overwrite the destination file.
 Echo n|MOVE /-y c:\file1.txt c:\dir\file1.txt


3. Error Handling and Return Codes

%ERRORLEVEL% = 0: The file(s) were successfully moved or renamed.
%ERRORLEVEL% = 1: The file was not found, could not be moved/renamed, or bad parameters were used.


[NOTES]

The source can include wildcards (* or ?), but the target cannot.

By default, Windows prompts for confirmation if the destination file already exists, unless the MOVE command is executed in a batch file or the /Y option is used.

You can suppress confirmation prompts globally by setting the COPYCMD environment variable:
 SET COPYCMD=/Y

The MOVE command is a built-in command in Windows, useful for quickly moving or renaming files across directories or drives. It's more flexible than the REN (rename) command because it allows for moving files to new locations as well. 

The MOVE command works similarly to the COPY command but deletes the source file after moving it.
