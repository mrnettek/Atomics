NET - NET SESSION and NET FILE Command Guide with Examples

The NET command is used to manage open files and user sessions on a computer or network. It provides functionality for viewing and managing user sessions, as well as managing open files on a shared server.


1. Syntax and Usage

[Syntax]
 NET SESSION
 NET SESSION [\\computername [/DELETE] | /LIST]
 NET FILE
 NET FILE [id [/CLOSE]]

[Key]
 computername - A computer whose shared resources you want to view. This is usually the name of the server or remote machine.
 domainname - The domain whose sessions you wish to view. By default, all domains in the local area network (LAN) are displayed.
 /DELETE - End the session and close all open files associated with the session. If computername is omitted, all sessions will be ended.
 /LIST - Display the information in a list format rather than a table.
 id - The identification number of the file (from the NET FILE list) to close.
 /CLOSE - Close an open file and remove the file lock. This will disconnect other users and remove the lock on the file.

Note:

Administrator privileges are required to run the NET SESSION command. Running this from a non-elevated session will return an ERRORLEVEL = 5 Access Denied.
The NET SESSION command requires the Server service to be running.

To create file shares, the Server service must be running, which also requires 'File and Print Sharing' to be installed.
